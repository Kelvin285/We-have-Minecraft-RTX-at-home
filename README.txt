CPU-based heightmap renderer with Minecraft-styled terrain.
Libraries required to run:
JOML (Java Open Math Library)
FastNoise

You can find them in about 2 minutes by doing a quick google search.
After that, you can run the project, sit back, and watch your computer explode, because the CPU is not meant for raytracing.
Also I have to include the licenses for the libraries I used I guess XD
